# fakeroblox

fakeroblox is an attempt to create a Luau environment that is as close to Roblox's as possible.

In its current state, building fakeroblox is a pain sorry. `./build.sh --release --nostatic`

# GOALS
* Instance system
* 1:1 Roblox error messages
* 2d graphics
* exploit functions (most similar to Synapse)

# NONGOALS
* 3d graphics
* networking
* rbxl or rbxm parsing

Contributions to nongoals may be welcome, but they aren't something I will be focusing on.
